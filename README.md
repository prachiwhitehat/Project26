# CoconutChutney
1. Take ½ cup tightly packed freshly grated coconut in a chutney grinder jar or a small grinder jar.
2. Then add 1 green chilli (chopped), ½ inch ginger (chopped) and 2 tablespoons roasted chana dal. You can even add 2 green chillies. For a spicy taste add 2 to 3 green chillies. Ginger can be skipped. 1 to 2 small garlic cloves can also be added instead of ginger.
3. Add salt as per taste. You can add less salt first. Then after grinding check the taste and add some more salt if required.
4. Add 3 to 4 tablespoons water. You can even make coconut chutney thick by adding less water. You can even skip roasted chana dal if you do not have it. Roasted chana dal is different from raw chana dal. Roasted chana dal is crunchy and directly edible, unlike raw chana dal.
5. Grind to a smooth consistency. If unable to grind or the chutney looks thick, then you can add 1 to 2 tablespoons more water.
6. Remove the coconut chutney with a spoon or spatula in a heat proof bowl like a steel bowl or a pyrex bowl or a glass bowl. Check the taste and at this step, you can add more salt if needed.
7. In a small pan or a tadka pan, heat ½ tablespoon sesame oil (gingelly oil – made from raw sesame seeds). Keep the flame to a low. You can also use sunflower oil or peanut oil or coconut oil or any neutral flavored oil.
8. add ½ teaspoon mustard seeds and let them begin to crackle.
9. Once the mustard seeds begin to crackle, add ½ teaspoon urad dal (split and husked black gram).
10. Once the urad dal begins to turn to a golden color, then add 1 dry red chilli (broken and seeds removed), 9 to 10 curry leaves and a pinch of asafoetida (hing). if the pan becomes very hot, then switch off the flame after adding the red chili, curry leaves and asafoetida.
11. . Switch off the flame and immediately pour the entire tempering on the ground coconut chutney in the bowl.
